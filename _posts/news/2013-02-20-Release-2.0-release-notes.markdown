	  <h2>Release 2.0.0</h2>
	  <p>We've finally released <strong>OpenGenesis 2.0.0</strong> - result of two months of a hard work</p>
      <p>The main concern of these release is asynchronous work and distributed executions. In order to make solution more stable and scalable
      To achieve these goals we added support for agents - software to be deployed on target machines to act as a slave node.
      And also added support for scheduled workflow execution. For now only destroy can be scheduled, thus allowing to specify automatic destruction time.
      But stay tuned! :)</p>

      <h2>New features</h2>
        <p>
         <ul>
           <li>Agents - allows to distribute workload from genesis server to registered "slave" nodes</li>
           <li>Lease time - allows to specify instance time to live - time for automatic destruction, which is a big deal in cloud based QA environments</li>
           <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypermedia support</a> for REST API: details can be found <a href="https://github.com/griddynamics/OpenGenesis/wiki/REST-API">here</a></li>
